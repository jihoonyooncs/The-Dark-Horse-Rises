#The Dark Horse Rises

###Synopsis
The Dark Horse Rises was a game made over a span of a little over a month that I made using C++, SDL, and OpenGL in Visual Studio. It was a project I was very passionate about and still my favorite project I have worked on so far. It got me passionate about programming and about game development. I wanted to make a game that was simple yet fun while feeling like a full game instead of a demo. Here I will go through the steps I took to make the game as well as explain parts of the code and the obstacles that I ran into while coding.
